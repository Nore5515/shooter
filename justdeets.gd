the bullet needs to only hit one zombie at a time
this could be done by having the bullet handle collision, not the zombie

the bullet, upon detection, creates a list of collisions, and waits a frame
then it disables collision (to flush any collisions) and waits antoher frame
THEN, after 2 frames, it sends the "hit" to the first zombie, and kills itself.
BLAMMO! ez pz.

prob...

TODO; Before zombie defense map, zombies need to pathfind to you 
TODO; To make it easier, zombies only pathfind up to a certian range
Once within range they cant resist and just charge you

TODO; Zombie Defense map! Zombies constantly spawn around you, and you must
try to survive. Maybe make it like the black ops zombies, where you can
repair barricades by standing next to them!


TODO; add unit hp so you dont insta die
TODO; have zombie bite slowly decrease your HP, but have decrease speed up
TODO; add medkits
TODO; you can survive zombie bite by constantly healing, and eventually it goes away



TODO; at some point have the rifle drop its mag while reloading
TODO; also at some point have zombies who dont see u rest their arms downwards
