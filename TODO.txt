the bullet needs to only hit one zombie at a time
this could be done by having the bullet handle collision, not the zombie

the bullet, upon detection, creates a list of collisions, and waits a frame
then it disables collision (to flush any collisions) and waits antoher frame
THEN, after 2 frames, it sends the "hit" to the first zombie, and kills itself.
BLAMMO! ez pz.

prob...
